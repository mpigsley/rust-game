## Rust Game

Work in progress. Some gameplay ideas:

* Turn-based, isometric battles in randomly generated environments
* D&D/OGL type character creation
* Randomly generated maps, cities, quests, etc.
* Will take some pieces of the roguelike formula

## Development

Check out [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for more information.

* `cargo build` to build the application in debug mode
* `cargo run` to build and run the application
